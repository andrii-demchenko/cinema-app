# üé• About cinema-app
This project is a basic implementation of a cinema ticket online shop application, which is based on Spring, Hibernate, database usage and REST principles. Data is displayed to user in JSON format.
# üéØ Goal
The aim of the project is to show possibilities in creating Java-applications with combined usage of Spring and Hibernate and to simulate simple online-shop functionality.
# üé¶ Cinema-app features
Cinema app uses database to store information about users, tickets and movie sessions. It also has basic authentication and authorization features with two roles - admin and user.   
Every user has a shopping cart and orders.  
Movie session contains information about movie, cinema hall and showtime.  
Every ticket contains information about a movie session and user.
- User has a email and password. You can register new user(all roles) and find one by email(admin only).
- Movie has a title and description. You can add a movie into database(admin only) or get a list of movies from DB.
- Cinema hall has a capacity and description. Operations with cinema halls are similar to operations with movies.
- Movie sessions can be added, updated, deleted by admin. User can get a list of availible movie sessions for desired date and movie.
- Shopping cart contains information about tickets user is willing to buy. User can add a ticket to shopping cart or get information about his shopping cart contents.
- Orders contain information about purchased tickets with order date and user to whom they belong. User can complete his order or get his orders list. Completing order will clean users shopping cart.
